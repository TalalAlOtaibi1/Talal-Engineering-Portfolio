Here is a link to an automated crossbow project I worked on collaboratively. The Crossbow mechanism folder also has some of the files created and worked on during development. https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/RMD/Walk+n%27+Fire+-+Walking-Beam+Crossbow

Augmented Welding Computer Vision Research:
A video presentation, a CVPR formatted LaTeX pdf report, and the code generated. Credit also goes to my fellow colleagued whom I collaborated with from start to end.

Macro Scale Atomic Force Microscope (Advanced Mechatronics II project):
Google drive showing all pre-lab analysis efforts, some scripts and data, as well as written reports describing and analyzing the results. A big thanks to Yifeng Liao for being an awesome project partner. This educational project wouldn't be possible without the guidance from Dr. Lei Zhou and Ian Heyman (UT Austin).
