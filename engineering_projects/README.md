Macro Scale Atomic Force Microscope (Advanced Mechatronics II project):
Google drive showing all pre-lab analysis efforts, some scripts and data, as well as written reports describing and analyzing the results. A big thanks to Yifeng Liao for being an awesome project partner. This educational project wouldn't be possible without the guidance from Dr. Lei Zhou and Ian Heyman (UT Austin). Google drive due to file size constraints:
